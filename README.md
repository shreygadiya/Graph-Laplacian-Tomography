# Graph-Laplacian-Tomography
MATLAB implementation of "Graph Laplacian Tomography From Unknown Random Projections". Note that I am not the original author of the paper. 
This was an attempt to reproduce the results in MATLAB for eduational purposes.

You need to download the datasets from https://www.fips.fi/dataset.php, to run the code on them. 
As of now, the the code for SheppLogan phantom is uncommented and requires no dataset to download.
